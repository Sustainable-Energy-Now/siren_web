    <p>This is a web interface to Powermatch, an open source python app for matching and balancing
    Renewable Energy resources to the load on the South West Interconnected system(SWIS).
    Powermatch takes as input load and generation data from Powermap. Powermatch quantifies and costs the dispatchable energy generation, storage and CO2-e emissions. 
    The parameters passed to Powermatch are stored in database tables.
    The objective of Powermatch is to take the raw output from Powermap for a demand year and scenario and 
    establish a baseline that scenario. Begin by setting the merit order for the technologies, then create a baseline
    with those settings.  Finally by various means we create variants to the baseline.
    Variants are created by varying the capacity or other attributes of the various renewable technologies used
    in a scenario.  The objective of creating variants is to optimise  specified outcomes such as emissions or 
    levelised cost of energy (LCOE).
    In this main panel you can select the Demand Year from the available data shown in the drop down list below.
    Select the level of detail and click submit to run Power Match.  This will both create and store the scenario
    baseline and display the outcome.  This is a pre-requisite to creating variants.
