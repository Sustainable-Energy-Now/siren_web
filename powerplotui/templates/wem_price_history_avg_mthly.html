        <h1>WEM Monthly Average Price History</h1>

        <p>This 3D image shows average period wholesale energy prices in the WA
        Wholesale Electricity Market (WEM) ... are they increasing? Are they
        here to stay? Are they a good or bad thing? ...is the market broken?</p>

        <h2>Negative prices - Causal factors:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Rooftop solar pushes down operational demand.</li>
            <li>Generators bid to be dispatched on the lowest price for a smaller amount of energy.</li>
            <li>Coal generators must stay operational 24/7, bidding negative prices to be dispatched.</li>
            <li>Large-scale generation certificate (LGC) owners also bid in negative to receive LGCs, down to the level of $40-50 MWh.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>So, what is the direction of travel?</h2>
        <p>As coal exits and LGCs expire (nominally 2030), there will be fewer
        negative prices. As battery storage ramps up, it will flatten out
        day-night price volatility, smoothing operational demand and introducing
        a new 'baseload power 2.0'.</p>

        <h2>Are negative prices good or bad?</h2>
        <p>They are simply a feature of the market transition, encouraging battery
        storage investments, favoring first movers, and partially eating its own
        lunch.</p>

        <p>Negative prices benefit users trading directly on the energy market,
        such as energy wholesalers, batteries, and heavy industry.</p>

        <p>There is an optimal amount of storage to flatten operational demand and
        reduce shortage risk, though current incentives may not drive investment
        at that level.</p>
