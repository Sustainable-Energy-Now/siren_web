### Wholesale Market Terms

| **Negative Price** | When the wholesale price falls below $0/MWh. . Generators are allowed to offer negative prices during intervals, when generation exceeds demand, to avoid the costs of stopping and restarting generating plant.  Coal and to a lesser extent gas plants have these costs.|
| **Price Spike** | A trading interval where the balancing price suddenly jumps from earlier prices, usually at or near the offer price ceiling|
| **Price Volatility** | Standard deviation of wholesale prices, indicating price variability. |

## Formulae and Calculations

### Renewable Energy Percentage

**RE% (Operational)**
```
RE% (Operational) = (Renewable Generation / Operational Consumption) x 100

Where:
  Renewable Generation = Wind + Solar (Utility) + Biomass + Storage Discharge
  Operational Consumption = Total consumption from grid sources. This represents electricity delivered through the grid.
```

**RE% (Underlying)**
```
RE% (Underlying) = (Total Renewable Generation / Underlying Consumption) x 100

Where:
  Total Renewable Generation = Wind + Solar (Utility) + Solar (DPV) + Biomass + Storage Discharge
  Underlying Consumption = Operational Consumption + Estimated Self Consumed DPV Generation
```

### Emissions Calculations

**Total Emissions**
```
Total Emissions (tonnes CO2-e) = Sum of (Generation by Fuel Type x Emissions Factor)

Emissions Factors:
  Gas:  380 kg CO2-e/MWh (typical CCGT)
  Coal: 900 kg CO2-e/MWh (typical black coal)
  Wind, Solar, Biomass: 0 kg CO2-e/MWh
```

**Emissions Intensity**
```
Emissions Intensity (kg CO2-e/MWh) = Total Emissions / Operational Consumption
```

### Year-over-Year Change

**Percentage Change**
```
YoY Change (%) = ((Current Period Value - Previous Period Value) / Previous Period Value) x 100
```

**Percentage Point Change**
```
YoY Change (pp) = Current Period RE% - Previous Period RE%

Note: Use percentage points (pp) for comparing percentages, not percentage change.
Example: RE% increased from 35% to 40% = +5 pp (not +14.3%)
```

### Target Status

**Gap to Target**
```
Gap (pp) = Actual RE% - Target RE%

Status:
  Gap > 0:  "Ahead of target"
  Gap = 0:  "On target"
  Gap < 0:  "Behind target"
```

### Quarterly Aggregations

**Quarterly Summary**
```
Quarterly Consumption = Sum of Monthly Consumptions (Jan-Mar, Apr-Jun, Jul-Sep, Oct-Dec)
Quarterly Generation = Sum of Monthly Generations
Quarterly RE% = (Quarterly Renewable Generation / Quarterly Consumption) x 100
```

**Year-to-Date Summary**
```
YTD Consumption = Sum of all monthly consumption from January to current month
YTD Generation = Sum of all monthly generations from January to current month
YTD RE% = (YTD Renewable Generation / YTD Consumption) x 100
```

### Wholesale Price Statistics

**Average Price (Volume-Weighted)**
```
Avg Price = Sum(Price x Volume) / Sum(Volume)
```

**Price Volatility (Standard Deviation)**
```
Std Dev = sqrt(Sum((Price - Avg Price)^2 x Volume) / Sum(Volume))
```

**Negative Price Count**
```
Negative Intervals = Count of trading intervals where Price < $0/MWh
```

**Price Spike Count**
```
Spike Intervals = Count of trading intervals where Price > $300/MWh
```

### Monte Carlo Simulation

**Achievement Probability**
```
Probability = (Count of simulations achieving target / Total simulations) x 100

Parameters:
  - Commissioning probability by status
  - Commissioning delay distribution
  - Capacity factor variance
  - Consumption growth uncertainty
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

### General

**Q: What is the difference between Operational and Underlying Consumption?**
A: Operational consumption measures electricity delivered through the grid. Underlying consumption includes operational consumption plus rooftop solar generation consumed by households before export. Underlying consumption represents total electricity consumption.

**Q: Why are there two RE% measures?**
A: RE% (Operational) shows renewables contribution to grid electricity, while RE% (Underlying) includes behind-the-meter solar, giving a complete picture of renewable energy in the system.

**Q: What is the 2040 target?**
A: The proposed SWIS target is for 100% renewable energy by 2040, measured on an operational consumption basis.

### Data and Calculations

**Q: Where does the data come from?**
A: Generation data comes from AEMO SCADA systems, demand data from system operator reports, and DPV estimates from network operators. Wholesale prices are from WEM market data.

**Q: How often is data updated?**
A: Monthly performance data is typically available within 2-3 days of month end. Real-time data is updated every 5 minutes.

**Q: Why don't storage emissions show in the table?**
A: Storage (batteries, pumped hydro) doesn't generate emissions directly - it stores and releases electricity. The emissions are attributed to the original generation source.

### Reports

**Q: Can I download reports?**
A: Yes, use the Print function to save as PDF, or published reports are available in the Published Reports section.

**Q: What does "Published" mean for a report?**
A: Published reports are frozen versions that have been reviewed and approved for external distribution. They cannot be edited.
