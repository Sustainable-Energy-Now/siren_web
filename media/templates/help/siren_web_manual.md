## Powermatch Module

### Overview

PowerMatch is a web-based interface for matching and balancing Renewable Energy resources to the load on the South West Interconnected System (SWIS). The application quantifies and costs dispatchable energy generation, storage, and CO2-e emissions by taking input from Powermap load and generation data.

### Key Features

- **Renewable Energy Matching**: Balance renewable resources with system load

- **Cost Analysis**: Calculate levelised cost of energy (LCOE)

- **Emissions Tracking**: Quantify CO2-e emissions

- **Scenario Analysis**: Create and compare different energy scenarios

- **Real-time Progress**: Monitor analysis progress with live updates

### Navigation Overview

The PowerMatch interface consists of four main sections:

1. **Home**: Scenario and demand year selection

2. **Merit Order**: Configure technology dispatch priority

3. **Baseline Scenario**: Set parameters and run analysis

4. **Variations**: Create and analyze scenario variants

### Home Page - Scenario Selection

#### Purpose

The home page allows you to select the demand year and scenario that will be used throughout your PowerMatch session. This selection is a prerequisite for all other functions.

#### Steps to Configure

1. **Select Demand Year**: Choose from available demand years in the dropdown

2. **Select Scenario**: Choose the scenario you want to analyze

3. **Apply Settings**: Click the "Apply Settings" button to confirm your selection

#### Important Notes

- Both demand year and scenario must be specified before proceeding

- The selected scenario becomes the basis for all subsequent analysis

- Data availability depends on what has been imported from Powermap

### Merit Order Configuration

#### Purpose

The merit order determines the dispatch priority of different energy technologies. Technologies higher in the list are dispatched first when demand needs to be met.

#### Interface Components

**Merit Order Panel (Left Side)**

- **Active Technologies**: Technologies that will be used in the analysis

- **Drag and Drop**: Reorder technologies by dragging items up or down

- **Color Coding**: Each technology has a color based on emissions characteristics

**Excluded Resources Panel (Right Side)**

- **Excluded Technologies**: Technologies not included in the current analysis

- **Move Between Lists**: Drag technologies between merit order and excluded lists

#### How to Configure Merit Order

1. **Reorder Technologies**:

   - Click and drag technology items within the Merit Order list

   - Higher position = higher dispatch priority

   - Lower emissions technologies typically go higher

2. **Include/Exclude Technologies**:

   - Drag technologies between "Merit Order" and "Excluded Resources" lists

   - Only technologies in the Merit Order list will be used in analysis

3. **Save Configuration**:

   - Click "Save Merit Order" button to save your configuration

   - Page will reload to confirm changes

#### Best Practices

- Place renewable technologies (solar, wind) at the top

- Order by emissions intensity (lowest first)

- Consider economic dispatch order for conventional technologies

### Baseline Scenario Management

#### Purpose

The baseline scenario establishes the foundation for your analysis by setting technology capacities, carbon pricing, and discount rates.

#### Configuration Parameters

**Economic Settings**

- **Carbon Price**: Set the carbon price ($/tonne CO2-e) for emissions costing

- **Discount Rate**: Set the discount rate (%) for economic calculations

**Technology Capacity Settings**

- **+0.7 to +1.0**: Strong positive correlation

- **+0.3 to +0.7**: Moderate positive correlation

- **-0.3 to +0.3**: Weak or no correlation (independent outputs) ‚Üê **Best for diversification**

- **-0.7 to -0.3**: Moderate negative correlation

- **-1.0 to -0.7**: Strong negative correlation (anti-correlated)

- **-1.0**: Perfect negative correlation (outputs move in opposite directions)



##### Complementarity Score

**Range**: 0.0 to 1.0



Calculated as: `1 - |correlation|`



- **0.9 to 1.0**: Excellent complementarity (perfect for portfolio diversification)

- **0.7 to 0.9**: High complementarity (very good for diversification)

- **0.4 to 0.7**: Moderate complementarity (some diversification benefit)

- **0.0 to 0.4**: Low complementarity (limited diversification benefit)



##### Variability Reduction

**Range**: Can be negative or positive (expressed as percentage)



- **Positive values**: Combining the sources reduces output variability (desirable)

- **> 20%**: Significant reduction in variability

- **10-20%**: Moderate reduction

- **0-10%**: Small reduction

- **Negative values**: Combining actually increases variability (undesirable)



##### Complementary Periods Percentage

**Range**: 0% to 100%



Percentage of time when one facility is producing above 30% while the other is below 30%.



- **> 40%**: Frequently complementary

- **20-40%**: Sometimes complementary

- **< 20%**: Rarely complementary



#### Interpretation Guide



The system provides an automatic interpretation combining all metrics. Here are some common patterns:



**Pattern 1: Ideal Complementarity (Solar + Wind)**

- Correlation: -0.2 to +0.2

- Complementarity: 0.8+

- Variability Reduction: 15%+

- Interpretation: "Weak correlation - outputs are largely independent | High complementarity - excellent for portfolio diversification | Combining reduces variability by 18%"



**Pattern 2: Similar Sources (Two Solar Farms)**

- Correlation: +0.8

- Complementarity: 0.2

- Variability Reduction: 2%

- Interpretation: "Strong positive correlation | Low complementarity - outputs follow similar patterns | Combining provides minimal variability reduction"



**Pattern 3: Anti-Correlated (Day Solar + Night Wind)**

- Correlation: -0.6

- Complementarity: 0.6

- Variability Reduction: 25%

- Interpretation: "Moderate negative correlation (anti-correlated - when one is high, other tends to be low) | Moderate complementarity | Combining significantly reduces output variability"



#### Using Metrics for Decision-Making



**Portfolio Optimization**:

- Look for complementarity scores > 0.7

- Prefer negative correlations or near-zero correlations

- Prioritize combinations with high variability reduction



**Risk Management**:

A: Yes, use Plotly's built-in download button in the chart toolbar to save as PNG or SVG.



**Q: Can I view multiple years?**  

A: Currently, you can select one year at a time. To compare years, you'll need to generate separate charts.



**Q: Why do some facilities not appear in the dropdown?**  

A: Only facilities with renewable technology (renewable flag = 1) are shown.



#### Metrics and Calculations



**Q: How is the Combined Total calculated?**  

A: Combined Total = Facility 1 quantum + Facility 2 quantum at each time point.



**Q: What's the difference between Quantum and Supply?**  

A: Both are plotted if they differ. Quantum typically represents theoretical output, while Supply represents actual delivered output. If they're identical, only one trace is shown.



**Q: How is weekly aggregation calculated?**  

A: The year is divided into 52 weeks (168 hours each), and values are averaged within each week.



**Q: How is monthly aggregation calculated?**  

A: Data is grouped by calendar month, and values are averaged within each month.



**Q: What does "Complementary Periods" mean?**  

A: The percentage of time when one facility is producing above 30% of its maximum while the other is below 30%. Higher percentages indicate better complementarity.



#### Date Ranges



**Q: Why do the seasons seem backwards?**  

A: The system uses Southern Hemisphere seasons (e.g., Summer = Dec-Feb). This is appropriate for Australian data.



**Q: Can I select non-contiguous months?**  

A: No, the system requires a continuous range from start month to end month.



**Q: Does date filtering affect correlation calculations?**  

A: Yes, all metrics are calculated only on the filtered data range.



#### Technology Aggregation



**Q: How many facilities are included in technology aggregation?**  

A: The info panel shows the count. All facilities with the selected technology are automatically included.



**Q: Can I exclude specific facilities from technology aggregation?**  

A: Not currently. All facilities with the selected technology are included.



**Q: Why is my technology total different from my expectations?**  

A: Verify that all expected facilities are tagged with the correct technology in the database.



#### Performance



**Q: Why is hourly data slow?**  

A: Hourly data for a full year contains 8,760 data points per facility. Use date range filters or switch to weekly/monthly aggregation for better performance.



**Q: Can I improve chart responsiveness?**  

A: Use modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox), close unnecessary tabs, and use lower aggregation levels (weekly/monthly) for faster rendering.
